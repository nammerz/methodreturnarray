methodreturnarray
=================
arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

# 1. arr.index(5) - this will bring up the "3" from the array as
#indexes start at 0 and counts from there on. so 15 is 0, 
# 7 is 1, 18 is 2, and 15 is 3.

# 2. arr.index[5] - this brings up an undefined method; an error

# 3. arr[5] brings up 8 as it will count 5 spots from 15.
